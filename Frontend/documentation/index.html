                        <br>
                        Node.js is a JavaScript run time built needed to run a React App. You can install the
                        recommended version of Node.js from the official website <a
                            href="https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/en/</a>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Steps to setup the project on the system:</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold-text">Step 1 - Open The main-file: </span>Open the main-file. You can either
                        open the file in vs-code or any code editor of your choice and use the built-in terminal or you
                        can also open the main-file in file manager and open a terminal or git bash in the root of the
                        main-file.
                        <br>
                        <span class="bold-text">Step 2 - Install Node Modules: </span>To run Organiyo in local system
                        you will need to install the node modules. You can type "npm install" command in terminal of the
                        main-file's root.
                        <br>
                        <span class="bold-text">Step 3 - Running In Local Server: </span>Use "npm run dev" in the
                        terminal to run the project in local server. Most common local server is <a
                            href="http://localhost:5173/">http://localhost:5173/</a>.
                        <br>
                        <span class="bold-text">Step 4 - Creating A Production Build: </span>With "npm run
                        build" command you can build a product build of Organiyo. If any problem arises in deployment
                        you can try to build in local and by doing so you can identify the problem as running build
                        command gives out specific error message if any present. You can preview the production build by
                        running command "npm run preview".

                        There are some components which are used
                        by passing down props which are easy to understand.
                        There are many utils component that helps user to write code efficiently. Like to add animation
                        of framer motion there are Custom Components like DivAnimate for Y and X axis.

                    <h1>Redux Toolkit:Streamlined State Management</h1>
                    <h3>Centralized State Handling:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Redux Toolkit, housed within the src/redux directory, serves as the nerve center for
                        managing the application's global state.
                        <br>
                        This centralized approach eliminates the need for excessive prop drilling and promotes a clear,
                        single source of truth for state data.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Accessing State and Dispatching Actions:</h3>
                    <p>Components seamlessly tap into the Redux store's state and dispatch actions using two custom
                        hooks:
                        <br>
                        useAppDispatch: Dispatches actions to trigger state updates.
                        <br>
                        useAppSelector: Selects specific slices of state for component rendering.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Key Advantages:</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold-text">Enhanced Performance:</span> Redux Toolkit's streamlined approach often
                        leads to reduced code complexity and improved performance.
                        <br>
                        <span class="bold-text">Single Source of Truth:</span> A single Redux store maintains the
                        application's state, ensuring consistency and predictability.
                        <br>
                        <span class="bold-text">Clear Data Flow:</span> The unidirectional data flow pattern simplifies
                        reasoning about state changes and debugging.
                        <br>
                        <span class="bold-text">Well-Documented Reducer Slices:</span> Comprehensive documentation
                        within reducer slices fosters understanding and maintainability.
                    </p>

                        components in pages directory. For dynamic route we used slug for better user experience.
