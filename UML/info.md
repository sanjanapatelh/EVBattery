## Examples of Manufacturers and Their Battery IDs
Tesla: Tesla uses an integrated system where the battery ID can include the part number, production date, and battery type (e.g., 18650, 2170). Tesla also uses the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to track battery installations.

General Motors (GM): GM has an OnStar system that links vehicle diagnostics, including battery health, with a unique battery ID for tracking performance and warranty.

Nissan: Nissan uses a Battery Pack Serial Number (BPSN) to identify each battery pack, and this serial number is linked to the vehicle's VIN.

BYD: Chinese automaker BYD uses detailed identification for its battery systems, including unique part numbers, chemistry type, and sometimes a "Vehicle Integration Code".



## Difference b/w Battery Manufacturer’s ID , Automotive Manufacturer , Battery Pack ID
Battery Manufacturer’s ID: These companies (like Panasonic, LG Chem, etc.) assign an ID to the battery cells or modules they produce.

Automotive Manufacturer: The car manufacturer customizes the cells into a battery pack and may assign a new ID that integrates with their own tracking system, sometimes combining the cell maker's ID and their own.

Battery Pack ID: Once assembled, the pack is assigned an ID by the car manufacturer, often tied to the car's VIN for tracking and service purposes.
